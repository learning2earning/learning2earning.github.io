Learning To Earning
===

1. We need to utilize the vast information and resources of the internet to create viable and sustainable knowledge networks  that assist the modern student to cope with the increasing demands of the “DIGITAL SHIFT”.
2. To that end, we need to know and understand how we can make the internet work positively for our communities. There is a great deal of distractions with the advent of social media but if we are going to move forward in this information age we need better understanding of the complex nature of our unique problems within and surrounding community dynamics.
3. We are acutely aware of the plantation to penitentiary cycle that has all but engulfed our communities here in the  21st Century America.
4. THIS IS SITUATION CRITICAL: Our community is failing because we have collectively and individually failed to meet the demands of a changing social structure. Educationally, politically and economically we are losing the war badly because we are too focused on the individual and losing focus on the big picture.
5. The internet will either be a gateway or a barrier to our place in the new and improved American Dream.  We must do everything we can to make this resource an asset or another lost opportunity for advancement.
6. The ultimate goal here is to design and implement a comprehensive plans for constructive, productive and healthy communities. This is where technology, big data and the internet can be used most effectively.
7. To accomplish these goals children must come first. The children must be properly engaged through educational systems that can assist the learning process. To this end, there are new governmental guidelines being put in place  to focus on the deficiencies of the old educational system: STEM (Science , Technology , Engineering and Math).
8. The new STEM programs are general areas of focus to meet the demands of the “Digital Shift”. We need to make this our educational mission. Proficiency in these areas will ensure survival of our communities of tomorrow. So the main mission of the “LEARNING TO EARNING”is to support and supplement education tools in these areas.
9. This will be primarily a low-cost free website hub dependent on technologies, websites and apps that can enhance the education experience. This website will be a place that must be user friendly for parents, students and teachers. These groups must join forces to aid students in the knowledge quest. 
10. The sincere hope is to create a knowledge class of leaders in all these fields. We task all our community leaders to join forces using education to better our prognosis for a brighter future.
11. So this website can also become a forum to explore the possibilities that education can ensure by addressing this central problem we can battle most other issues that affect our community adversely.
12. Primarily this website will focus on the dilemma of the young black males who are becoming increasing dysfunctional and disenfranchised. We they cannot rap, sing ,score a touch- down or basket they believe these are the only viable option for escape. We must convince this segment of our community most of all. Either we build better schools or get accustomed to our youth being destined for the expanding penal system. This is not an acceptable option or solution.
